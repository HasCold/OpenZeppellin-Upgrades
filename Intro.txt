Smart contract deployed using OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins can be upgraded to modify their code, while presrving their address, state and balance.

This allows you to add iteratively add new features to your new project or fix any bugs you may find any bugs in production.

deployProxy in the OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins.


Upgrading Process :- 

User doesn't interact directly with the NUM1 smart contract.

User  --->>   Proxy Smart Contract  --->>   Update()  NUM1(Smart Contract)


---------------------- Important Points -------------------

Logic Use - Implementation Contract (NUM1, NUM2)
State Use - Proxy Contract (num 10)


. When you deploy a contract using deployProxy that contract instance can be upgraded later.
. We are using just like as a abstraction of Proxy Smart Contract which doesn't affect the immutability of our blockchain.
